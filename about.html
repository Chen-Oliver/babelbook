A web-based Project loosely based on the book The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges,
<br>where a library of hexagonal rooms is filled with books each 410 pages long and each <br>
page is 80 lines long consisting of random combinations of 25 letters(in the original book) <br>
(the page length is specified by the user in our case, and we use the entire alphabet).<br>
Theoretically, in the nearly-infinite amount of books that would be generated in such a library, <br>
any book ever written can be found. Perhaps even a book that allows navigation <br>
through the library(Unfortunately, we have not implemented a navigation/bokmarking system).<br>
<br>A better version of this exists on the web already:<a href='https://libraryofbabel.info'> Right Here </a> 
<br>Our project may take some inspiration from certain aspects of that website
<br>Example of how actual books can be generated(a page from Hamlet):

<br><br><br><h2>Nice Stats Bro </h2><br>
"Since one book is 1,312,000 characters, and since the average english word <br>
length is 5.1 characters, 1,312,000 / 5.1 = 257,255 (rounded up) words per book. <br>
At an average reading pace of 300 words per minute, you could get through one book <br>
in 857.51666 minutes (about 14.2919444 hours, 0.59549 days, or 0.0016303838061196 years). <br>
Taking the reciprocal, we see that one could read 613.352510 of these books per year. <br>
The average human lifespan (assuming the best conditions, where in Japan, the overall average human life expectancy)<br> 
is 84.6 years old, so one person could read 613.35... * 84.6 = 51889 books in <br>
their lifetime (assuming they start reading as soon as they are born and until their last breath, and never sleep or do anything else but read...).<br> 
That means if there are 29<sup>1312000</sup> (10<sup>10<sup>6.282999</sup>)<font size='3'> books and you can read 51889 books in one lifetime, <br>
it would then take 10<sup>10<sup>6.28299</sup></font> /<font size='3.5'> 51889 = 2.87185772303 * 101918661 lifetimes to read the whole library. That's<br>
287185772303...(insert 1.918650 Million digits here)...0 lifetimes."</font><br>
